Supported features:
- <a href="https://music.163.com/">网易云音乐</a> playback;
- Login via cellphone;
- Personal playlists;
- Three modes: sequential, random and single cycle.

Please be sure to check limitations before installation:
- You can’t listen to music without copyright and without payment;
- All functions are pieced together using open source code;
- Bugs are inevitable. Is it called a plugin without a bug?
- The icons are all hand-painted, if infringement, then delete.
